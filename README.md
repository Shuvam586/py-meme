## Introduction
This is a simple API which you can integrate into your code to fetch memes. The API can be integrated into most programming languages and returns a meme in the form of URLs.
## What you need
A good programming language and a working internet connection is all you need to use the API. Since the API returns simple URLs, you don't need to get any modules for your platform. All you need is to know how to make requests through the programming language of your choice.
## Basic procedure
Firstly you need to make a request to this endpoint

```https://api.pymeme.repl.co```

A simple request to the URL itself returns data related to a random meme. On top of that, you can pass certain arguments to get some different results. These will be discussed in the next section.
## Passing Arguments
Arguments can be passed as suffixes to the main URL, for example, adding `/help` to the end of the main URL leads to this documentation page. You can even add keywords to get specific memes. Usage of keywords has been discussed in the usage section of the documentation.
## Handling Errors
We run our API on very lightweight servers and it is not surprising that errors might occur. You need to get well acquainted on how to identify errors and what to do when an error occurs. Detailed instructions on error identification are provided in the usage section of the documentation.
